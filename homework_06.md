Notes
=====
We have learned a lot of things since the beginning of the sememster. and now it's time for us to apply these knowledge and solve interesting problems.

Extra
=====
If you want to clear the current drawing and move your turtle pen back to where it was at the beginning, here is how to do that:
```python
t.clear() # the current drawing will be wiped out after calling this
t.reset() # the turtle pen will return to the original location
```

Exercises
=========
* Read your notes, and use the code to draw a rectangular spiral from the center of the screen until it reaches one of the borders of the screen. Once that is done, turn it into a function. Modify the function to allow drawing spiral of different "tightness"- i.e. make the distance between parallel lines adjustable. Use this function to first draw one spiral, and then wipe out the drawing, and draw another spiral that is looser/sparser than the previous one.

* Bonus: draw the spiral in such a way that the lines that are parallel to top/bottom, left/right sides of the screen have their own colors. For example, you can make all horizontal lines red, and all vertical lines blue.

Results
=======
You should turn in one or two programs.
