Notes
=====
Use your homework to build a little portfolio!

Keep all your programs in one directory. You can create a new one for all the programs you have written and will write in the future, e.g. "programs". Keep it under your home directory or under Desktop so you can find it easily.

Name your program files wisely to make it easier to find the one you want. For example, if your program draws a square, you can call it "square.py", or "turtle_square.py". However, calling it "turtle.py" is less informative. Why? Well, next time you write a new program to draw a triangle with turtle, how would you name the new file?


Exercises
=========
* Write a program that draws a triangle on the screen. We have done this in class. But I want everybody to redo it all by yourself! How fast can you get it done?
* Write a program that draws a diamond on the screen. You have to draw one that is *not* also a square so no right angles allowed!


Results
=======
You should turn in *two* programs/files, they should be named differently, and both should end with ```.py```.
