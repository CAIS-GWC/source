Notes
=====
Functions are extremely useful. Practice a few times until you can create and use them comfortably.

Remember, when you define a function, you need to pay attention to the format, especially the indentation and the empty line at the end. Using a function does not require indentation.
If you define more than one function, each one should be given a unique name.

We learned new ways of controlling the turtle pen this week- ```goto(X, Y)```, ```penup()```, ```pendown()```. As a thought experiment, think about how you can draw a dotted line with a turtle pen.


Exercises
=========
* Write a program that draws a simple house- one with a triangular roof and square body- using functions. You should have two functions in your program, one that draws a square, one that draws a triangle.
* Write a program that draws a flower, whose petals are diomand-shaped. Use your program from last week- you already know how to draw a rhombus, and you can turn that into a function and use it repeatedly. It is certainly easier than typing dozens of ```forward()```! Note: the petals can overlap, or have gaps in between- just draw something pretty!


Results
=======
You should turn in *two* programs/files.
