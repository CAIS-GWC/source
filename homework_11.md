Notes
=====
Two functions related to turtle pen, ```xcor()``` and ```ycor()```, can tell you where the turtle is.

Using knowledge of the turtle's whereabouts, we then learned how to detect border conditions- conditions under which special actions need to be taken. And that allows us to achieve complicated maneuvers without using multiple loops.


Exercises
=========
* Draw a 'well', which is a square, and start the turtle inside the well facing any direction. Can you keep moving the turtle inside the well and let it "bounce" off the walls? When turtle bounces off the wall, it should leave the wall at an angle that's symmetrical to when it came to the wall.

* Bonus: how can you make turtle not going outside the wall, even just very slightly?

Results
=======
You should turn in one program.
